# Conformance Test Suite

This directory contains information regarding the Conformance Test Suite (CTS) and the Apache Atlas connector.

## Charts

The `charts` sub-directory contains a Helm chart to automate the execution of the CTS against the Apache Atlas
connector, to produce a set of repeatable CTS results.

## Results

you will find the following details:

- `openmetadata.conformance.testlab.results` - the detailed results, as produced by the CTS workbench itself
- Description of the k8s environment
    - `<version>.deployment` - details of the deployed components used for the test
    - `<version>.configmap` - details of the variables used within the components of the test
- The OMAG server configurations:
    - `omag.server.atlas.config` - the configuration of the Apache Atlas connector (proxy)
    - `omag.server.cts.config` - the configuration of the CTS workbench
- The cohort registrations:
    - `cohort.coco.atlas.local` - the local Apache Atlas connector (proxy) cohort registration information
    - `cohort.coco.atlas.remote` - the cohort members considered remote from the Apache Atlas connector (proxy)'s perspective
    - `cohort.coco.cts.local` - the local CTS Workbench cohort registration
    - `cohort.coco.cts.remote` - the cohort members considered remote from the CTS Workbench's perspective
